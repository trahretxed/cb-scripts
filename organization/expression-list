# This file is used by the validate-expression shell script to load expressions that match files you may want to delete from cbr/cbz files. 
# Lines may be commented out using #. You may also add lines of your own, comma delimited, in the order of title,expression,output,message. 
# The title column is simply a readable plain text description of the expression that is presented to the user in the script.
# The expression column holds each expression we wish to match when parsing cbr/cbz files. Be careful here as you don't want to match files you wish to keep. 
# The output column has two choices, count and list. Count returns the number of times the expression matches a file. 
# This should be used with files that are pretty safe to delete like text files or files left behind by the OS (Thumbs.db for example). 
# List should be used for files where we may match on files we want to keep. The user is presented with a list of file matches to they can decide if it will 
# delete wanted files in advance. The final column is the message column. This is a message that is presented to the user when they are prompted whether 
# they want to run the expression in column 1. This should include warnings or things the user should be watching before deciding to run the expression.
